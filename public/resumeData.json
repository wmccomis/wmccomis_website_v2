    "bio": "Hi! My name is Will McComis. I am a recent graduate from the University of Notre Dame. I earned a BS in Computer Science and found that my passion for software development grew during my time at Notre Dame. With my skills, I decided to build a website to showcase my projects and my interests. I earned my private pilot’s certificate in 2020, added an instrument rating in 2021, and recently earned my commercial pilot license in March 2023. It’s safe to say aviation has been a large factor in my life the last three years. Combining my passions for aviation and software, I will be joining the Hiller Group in Tampa leading their technology development at NDX. NDX’s mission is to develop innovative software and hardware solutions that optimize operations at airports and FBOs across the nation. In my website, you will see some of my favorite projects while in college as well as some fun stats about my trips flying the last three years. Check out my flying section! I have been working really hard on it.",
